		<p>Swami Vivekananda was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic
		Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and
		Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to 
		the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival
		of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of Indian nationalism as a tool of fight against
		the British empire in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna
		Mission. He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the words - "Sisters and brothers 
		of America ...," in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in
		Chicago in 1893.
		</p>
		<p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards
		spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings 
		were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to 
		humankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and 
		acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the 
		United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted 
		hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the
		United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint, and his
		birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day.
